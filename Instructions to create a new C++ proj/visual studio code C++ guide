1) ctrl + shift + p -> launch command pallet
2) select "Create c++ project"
3) replace launch.json with this ... this is found under the .vscode folder on the tree structure on the left
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "(gdb) Launch",
            "type": "cppdbg",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${workspaceFolder}/bin/main",
            "args": [],
            "stopAtEntry": false,
            "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
            "environment": [],
            "externalConsole": false,
            "MIMode": "gdb",
            "setupCommands": [
                {
                    "description": "Enable pretty-printing for gdb",
                    "text": "-enable-pretty-printing",
                    "ignoreFailures": true
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}

4) in the Makefile ... at the very last line, before "-o" add "-g" -> this adds the debug info

5) add any header files under the "include" folder

6) add any source files under the "src" folder, when including a header file in a source, just call out the header file name, don't have to account for the folder structure, the make file is smart enough to account for it ... 

7) if you have a custom "file_name.h" file with custom definition, you can drop the file in the include folder, and add "#include file_name.h" in main.cpp or where ever it needs used
